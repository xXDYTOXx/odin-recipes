                Adobo refers to a method of marinating and stewing for any cut of meat or fish in a briny mixture of vinegar, soy sauce, and spices. Filipino adobo  should not be confused with the spicy Spanish adobo sauce. Although they both share the Spanish name, they are vastly different in flavor and ingredients.

                This cooking method, like most of Filipino culture, is of mixed heritage. While not official, many consider chicken adobo to be the national dish of the Philippines. There are many regional varieties of adobo, but most recipes include vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, bay leaves, and black pepper. The meat is marinated and then stewed in this mixture, which yields a very flavorful, tangy, and tender meat. Adobo is usually served over a bed of fluffy rice to absorb the deliciously tangy sauce.

            <h3>Recipe For Filipino Adobo</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Begin by choosing a pot that's big enough to fit the chicken and pork adobo. Bring the pot to medium high heat and sauté the garlic and onions in hot oil
                </li>
                <li>Add the chicken pieces into the pot and sear on all sides. Searing means to brown the meat in high heat. This adds flavour and color to the meat. Make sure that the meat pieces are not wet or you will not achieve the desired color you are looking for. You can do this in batches so you do not overcrowd the pot because the juices from the meat will run out and thus prevent the browning effect of the meat. Add the pork and sear as well.
                </li>
                <li>The next step is to pour the vinegar, soy sauce, bay leaves, pepper, water, Knorr Chicken Cube. Bring this up to a boil over high heat then lower the fire to a simmer. Do not cover your pot or you will end up with a raw vinegar taste. This will take about 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>For a more flavour-filled adobo, remove the chicken and pork pieces from the pot and fry this separately in another pan for about 2-3 minutes. When done, throw in the fried meat pieces into the pot, add the sugar and simmer for another 6 minutes or until the sauce has reached a syrup-like consistency. To add fiber into your dish, add sliced Bok-Choi last and cook for 2 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>This all-time classic dish is now ready to be enjoyed by the whole family with a bowl of steaming rice.
